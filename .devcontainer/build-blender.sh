# there are easy to bring across; the deltas are marked ARCADE below.
#
# What needs it: tools/rigging/rig_character.py, which turns a
# reconstructed mesh into a Rigify-rigged .glb. That wants Blender >= 5.1,
# and Debian ships 4.3 - see the ARCADE note by the /usr/local/bin symlink.
#
# Two paths:
#
#   1. x86_64: the official binary from download.blender.org (fast).
#   2. Anything else (e.g. Linux ARM64, which blender.org does not
#      ship): clone the pinned tag and build from source against
#      Blender's official precompiled libraries
#      (projects.blender.org/blender/lib-linux_arm64). Takes a while
#      on first run; later runs are incremental.
#
# Idempotent: exits immediately when the installed `blender` already
# reports the pinned version.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   BLENDER_FORCE_SOURCE_BUILD=1  build from source even on x86_64.
#   BLENDER_SOURCE_DIR=...        where to clone/build (default ~/.cache/blender-source).
#   BLENDER_BUILD_JOBS=N          parallel build jobs (default: nproc).
#   BLENDER_SKIP_INSTALL=1        do nothing (opt out entirely).
